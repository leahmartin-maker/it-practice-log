January 2026: I have officially started my IT practice log.

January 2nd 2026: I have completed all courses in the Google IT professional support Course and recieved all of my certificates. I linked them to my Linkedin account. 

I have completed my first 3 IT projects. Ive learned to use Git and Github, as well as publishing those projects to my account. I created a Website through Github, i plan on coming back to this 
on Sunday and using AI to help me create a user interface with CSS. I am very happy with all ive accomplished today and i am excited to continue. So far i like the idea of using my skills to 
build websites, with my strong background in Art. 

Monday Jan 5th 2026: I did come back sunday to do more on my site. I wasnt home so i did need to learn to clone my repository to the computer i was working on. I have been using Gemini 
to help me rewrite my resume to apply for entry level IT jobs and break into the field. I started a FREECODECAMP course on coding, and ive decided to stop being afraid of being
underqualified and to push for what i actually want to do in life. i am an artist, and i want to continue to create things, i want to pursue the full stack dev path. i really
enjoy the coding aspect along with the ability to create ANYTHING and make things beautiful. my specialties. Im very excited for the path ahead and im commited to learning something
new every single day!
